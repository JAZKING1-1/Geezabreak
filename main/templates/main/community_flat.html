    <div class="space-y-6">
      <div class="rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-lg bg-white/80 border border-yellow-200">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">De-stress</h3>
        <p>Engaging sensory processes can help calm an overstimulated mind by providing a moment of comfort and calm where the mind is absorbing and refocusing attention. Additionally, a sensory environment can help those withdrawn feel more comfortable in their surroundings allowing for positive interaction.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-lg bg-white/80 border border-yellow-200">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Sensory stimulation</h3>
        <p>Encouraging exploration of their environment can help individuals have a better understanding of the world around them and their ability to interact and react within it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-lg bg-white/80 border border-yellow-200">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Enhance learning through play</h3>
        <p>Using a Montessori approach allows for self-directed activity, hands-on learning, and collaborative play. Sensory play helps children develop their senses, encourages problem-solving, and helps build nerve connections within the brain. Engaging different areas of the brain helps children absorb and retain more information.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-lg bg-white/80 border border-yellow-200">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Improve balance, movement and spatial orientation</h3>
        <p>Use of sensory rooms helps develop visual processing, fine and gross motor skills, and facilitates day-to-day living. It is also highly beneficial to individuals with physical difficulties.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-lg bg-white/80 border border-yellow-200">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Develop communication skills</h3>
        <p>For individuals with autism, verbal and non-verbal communication can be a challenge. Interactive sensory areas can help withdrawn individuals to engage. Focusing on the use of sensory toys with sound can also help promote vocalisation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-lg bg-white/80 border border-yellow-200">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Improve focus</h3>
        <p>When individuals are over-stimulated (common in ADHD), sensory equipment helps draw attention back to the task at hand. This can help people cope in environments where calm and concentration are key.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-lg bg-white/80 border border-yellow-200">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Promote socialisation</h3>
        <p>Using a sensory room with others in a calm and stress-free environment helps develop social skills among peers and builds understanding of how actions affect others.</p>
