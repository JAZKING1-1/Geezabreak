                        <p>
                            As a registered care provider in Scotland, Geeza Break is committed to the
                            principles of the <strong>Duty of Candour</strong>. This legal duty, in place
                            since April 2019, ensures openness and transparency by requiring organisations
                            to inform individuals of serious adverse events, offer support, and reflect on
                            lessons learned to improve future practice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are pleased to report that during 2024–25, <strong>no Duty of Candour
                            notifications</strong> were required across our services. All staff receive
                            training through the Scottish Social Services Council to maintain awareness
                            and compliance with this duty.
